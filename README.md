# Project Title: Hotel Booking Analysis
# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Project Summary:
The Hotel Booking Analysis project aims to analyze hotel booking data to gain insights into booking patterns, guest demographics, and booking trends. This analysis can help hotel management optimize their operations, improve customer satisfaction, and make informed business decisions.

## Methods and Technologies Used:
1. **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis tasks.
2. **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation, preprocessing, and analysis.
3. **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These libraries are employed for data visualization, enabling the creation of informative charts and plots.
4. **Jupyter Notebook**: Used as the development environment to run Python code interactively and document the analysis process.

## Results:
1. **Top Countries by Successful Bookings**:
   - Identified the countries with the highest number of successful bookings, visualized as a bar chart.

2. **Average Nights Booked by Hotel Type**:
   - Analyzed the average number of nights booked for different hotel types, visualized using box plots.

3. **Room Type Discrepancies**:
   - Determined the occurrences where the assigned room type differed from the reserved room type, visualized as a count plot.

4. **Booking Trends Over Months**:
   - Analyzed booking trends over different months in 2016 and 2017, particularly for City Hotel bookings, visualized using line plots.

5. **Numerical Characteristics Analysis**:
   - Examined numerical characteristics of 'adults', 'children', and 'babies' variables to identify the one with the highest average, visualized using bar plots.

6. **Popularity of Hotel Types Among Guests with Kids**:
   - Created a new column 'total_kids' by combining 'children' and 'babies' and determined which hotel type is more popular among guests with kids, visualized using a pie chart.

7. **Churn Rate Analysis**:
   - Created a variable 'has_kids' based on whether at least one child was indicated during booking and calculated the churn rate for guests with and without kids, visualized as a stacked bar chart.

## Visualizations:
- Each analysis is accompanied by relevant visualizations, such as bar charts, box plots, count plots, line plots, and pie charts, providing clear insights into the data.

This project offers valuable insights into hotel booking patterns and guest demographics, empowering hotel management to make data-driven decisions to enhance guest experiences and optimize operations.
